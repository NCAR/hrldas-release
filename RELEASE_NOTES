=========================================================================
======================= HRLDAS v3.8 Release Notes =======================
=========================================================================

LSM capabilities/enhancements
----------------------------------

- Added 3 new dveg option for reading LAI from forcing and 1 new dveg option for reading FVEG;
   Also added initial commit of crop model; currently runs crop everywhere
    dveg =  6 -> dynamic vegetation on  (use FVEG = SHDFAC from input)
    dveg =  7 -> dynamic vegetation off (use input LAI; use FVEG = SHDFAC from input)
    dveg =  8 -> dynamic vegetation off (use input LAI; calculate FVEG)
    dveg =  9 -> dynamic vegetation off (use input LAI; use maximum vegetation fraction)
    dveg = 10 -> crop model on (use maximum vegetation fraction)

- Added glacier options:
    opt_gla = 1 -> original Noah-MP version
    opt_gla = 2 -> no ice phase change or sublimation (like Noah glacier)

- Added surface resistance as an option (now four options)
    opt_sfc = 1 -> Sakaguchi and Zeng, 2009 (has been Noah-MP default)
    opt_sfc = 2 -> Sellers (1992)
    opt_sfc = 3 -> adjusted Sellers to decrease RSURF for wet soil
    opt_sfc = 4 -> option 1 for non-snow; rsurf = rsurf_snow for snow (set as RSURF_SNOW in MPTABLE)

- Made the specification of urban types more general 
   (LOW_DENSITY_RESIDENTIAL, HIGH_DENSITY_RESIDENTIAL, HIGH_INTENSITY_INDUSTRIAL), 
   now set in the MPTABLE dependent on classification scheme (i.e., not limited to 31,32,33); 
   this is for future coupling with urban models.


LSM bug fixes
----------------------------------

- Fixed two bugs with OPT_STC=3

- Fixed bug in new surface resistance option causing divide by 0

- Write a message if incoming snow water and snow depth are inconsistent
  Reduce SWE to 2000mm if input is >2000mm, Noah-MP limits SWE internally to 2000mm
  
- Recalculate ESTG in glacier code when snow is melting, will decrease sublimation, 
   but likely increase melting


Driver capabilities/enhancements
----------------------------------

- Added instructions and scripts for extraction of single point forcing and setup files from 
   2D datasets (e.g., NLDAS)

- Structure for spatially-varying soil properties added to DRV and LSM; 
   Use of the 2D/3D fields in the driver and DRV commented to be consistent with WRF


Driver bug fixes
----------------------------------

- Zero forcing where not land to prevent overflow with ifort

=========================================================================
======================= HRLDAS v3.7 Release Notes =======================
=========================================================================

New capabilities:

1. A parallel capability has been added by Wei Yu (weiyu@ncar.edu) to support mpi only.

 To compile with parallel version
  edit the file 'user_build_options'
  uncommment the compiler section with MPI (available for pgf90 and ifort compilers)

 To compile with sequential version
  edit the file 'user_build_options'
  uncommment the compiler section without MPI


2. System setup and execution now requires only a WRF/WPS geo_em file. 
    Dependence on the wrfinput file has been removed.


3. As part of #2, initialization no longer occurs in the first forcing file, 
    but in the file listed in the namelist as:
    
    HRLDAS_SETUP_FILE = ""

   The initialization fields are:
     SNOW,CANWAT,TSK,TSLB,SMOIS
   
   This file also contains the static grid/domain information:
     XLAT,XLONG,TMN,HGT,SEAICE,MAPFAC_MX,MAPFAC_MY,SHDMAX,SHDMIN,XLAND,IVGTYP,ISLTYP,DZS,ZS

   This file can also contains some optional fields:
     LAI
     
   NOTE: a WRF input file can be used as a HRLDAS_SETUP_FILE

4. The timing structure has changed:

   - The initial conditions are the states at START time. 
   - First forcing file used is START time + FORCING_TIMESTEP 
   - First integration is START time + NOAH_TIMESTEP 
   - First output file is now START time + OUTPUT_TIMESTEP     
   - RESTART file states are consistent with OUTPUT file states with the same time stamp


5. Instructions for using GLDAS and NLDAS as forcing has been provided in addition to the NARR instructions (see /docs)
     Also, a NCL script has been included for preparing single- or multi-point forcing
     

6. Initial LAI (if present in the HRLDAS_SETUP_FILE) will be used to initialize the leaf and stem carbon pools


7. Removed dependence on external GRIB tables for forcing creation; now in namelist only
